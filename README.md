# Rocket-Feed

It is based on a simulation of a feed in a social network, to study and improve the use of React.

-in the feed, it is possible to add posts, which access an array built in the front-end itself, simulating a structure that would be built from a .json that would be
coming from some back-end in a restfull API.

-It is possible to add comments to the posts, where they are shown: the time the comment was made, photo of the user who commented, and a button option to give
like the comment.

# Technical information:

-React js + vite js.

-Hooks: useState.

-Dynamic app.

-date-fns for setting formatting and inhibiting the time tag in this case.

-TypeScript to type the entire app, avoiding possible errors due to the dynamic characteristic of JavaScript.
